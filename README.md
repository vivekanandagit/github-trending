- I prioritised simplicity and avoided over engineering the solution
- Used create react app as base
- Used ReactJs and ant design to match with the job description despite having not worked on react in the past 2 years
- Used styled components for better readability during review. I would ideally maintain a file to keep the style variables, but felt like an overkill for the task and hence avoided
- went with grid layout instead of flex for the cards to maintain consistent heights
- picked the date 7 days prior for the API as the quality of results for current date were not good
- Use of typescript seemed an overkill and hence avoided it
